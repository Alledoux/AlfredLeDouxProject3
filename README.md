In order to use the source code you will have to download the file at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com. These contain the data that is stored into the data structures. After you download them you have to open it and delete the first line("	drugName	condition	review	rating	date	usefulCount"). I deleted these to make parsing easier.
Download them and move them into the same folder as the main.cpp and main.py. double check the file path to make sure you can read from the file.
After this you should be able to run the code. It will prompt you for a drug name. You can open the file downloaded to search for some drug names that are present or use these that I randomly chose.
